-   Snippets and results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Help:** ++alt+shift+k++ or Tools/Keyboard Shortcuts Help.

Orientation
===========

**Commands**

-   ++ctrl+up++; command history.
-   ++tab++; completion for all.
-   ++ctrl+l++; clear the console.
-   Tools/Global Options... set up RStudio.
-   `view(dataframe)`; open a spreadsheet, show in new window, sort the
    rows, search, filter the rows.

<!-- -->

``` r
df <- data.frame(colA = c(1, 2), colB = c(3, 6))
df
```

    ##   colA colB

**IDE panes**

-   Environment pane; load, save, remove objects, read a dataset,
    import dataset.
-   History pane; idem, clear all or one item at the time, copy the
    command in the console pane, reload a command with ++shift+enter++ and
    run it.
-   File pane; working directories, files, add a new folder, rename
-   `getwd()`; get working directory.
-   `setwd()`; set working directory.
-   Plot pane; save (extension, size, resolution).
-   Package pane; update.
-   Help pane; pages.
-   Viewer pane; more than plots!

Programming
===========

**Scripting**

-   ++ctrl+shift+m++; `%>%`.
-   ++alt+minus++; `<-`.
-   ++ctrl+shift+c++; add/delete a `#` for commenting.

<!-- -->

``` r
%>% 

<- 

# comment
```

**Code**

-   ++ctrl+alt+i++; new chunk.

-   Convert into a function.

1.  Type code,
2.  Highlight it,
3.  Code/Extract Function to create a function:

This:

``` r
rnorm(10, 0, 1)
```

Becomes:

``` r
rnorm <- function() {
  rnorm(10, 0, 1)
}
```

-   ++ctrl+alt+"click"++; multiple cursors for typing!
-   Switch between Default, Vim and Emacs modes with
    Tools/Global Options/Code/Keybindings.
-   ++shift+alt+g++; go to line.
-   ++ctrl+f++: find/replace in the current document.
-   ++alt+o++, ++alt+shift+o++; fold/unfold the code.
-   ++ctrl+p++; jump between symbols like (), {}, \[\].
-   ++ctrl+shift+enter++; run and source the code.
-   ++ctrl+enter++; run and source the code.
-   ++ctrl+shift+f10++; restart, refresh the R session.

**Error handling**

RStudio traces back the error origin.

Toggle the show/hide traceback in the console when there is an error or
rerun with the bug, watch the right pane for traceback.

Investigate, highlight the next line of code, click in the traceback
window, click the dropdown menu in the Global Environment (upper-right).
Stop, continue in the debugger mode, press ++c++, press ++q++.

Add/remove breakpoints, where the line numbers are.

-   `debugonce`; automatically call the debugger when the function is
    called, but only once.
-   `debug`, `undebug`; automatically call the debugger when the
    function is called.

Add `options(error=browser)` or `options(error=NULL)` at the beginning
of the script; R automatically open the debugger mode.

-   ++n++; next line.
-   ++"step-into"++ icon.
-   ++shift+f4++; step into.
-   ++shift+f6++; execute the remainder of the bug.

Project
=======

-   Create a project with a folder and all the files (Global
    Environment, History, etc.): New Directory, Existing Directory,
    Version Control... Empty Project, R Package (project), Shiny
    Web Application.
-   Create a Git repository with the new project

**Commands**

-   ++ctrl+shift+f++; find in files.
-   ++ctrl+f9++, ++f10++; go backwards/forwards.

**Packrat**

Packrat is a dependency management system for R. Use one version of a
package for one project, another version of a package for another
project. Associate a project with its own set of packages.

-   [Packrat](rstudio.github.io/packrat/).
-   Activate Packrat when creating a project or
    Tools/Project Options/Packrat.
-   The library is virtually separate from R library.
-   Perfect for collaborating with GitHub

Packages
========

**Introduction to R packages**

Anything that can be automated, should be automated. Do as little as
possible by hand. Do as much as possible with functions.

Process:

-   Writing R functions.
-   Documenting functions.
-   Writing tests.
-   Checking compatibility.
-   Building the package for sharing and using.

See the book: [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz).

**Create a new R package**

Create a new directory with new files, folders, and meta-information.

**To update or not to update**

RStudio generates the NAMESPACE content for you automatically.

See the book: [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html).

**Import & load source files**

Move existing functions from an existing project into the new package.
The function are moves to a new folder in the project.

Test created functions all in once with the Load All command in the
Build Tab.

Simulations:

-   ++ctrl+shift+l++
-   ++ctrl+shift+f10++; restart a R session.

**Packages documentation**

Create a help page (.Rd file). Written in HTML.

Use the `roxigen` [package](http://roxygen.org/) to document.

Tools/Project Optons/Build Tools/Generate documentation. Generate the
doc, add comments.

First, create a doc skeleton above the function:

-   ++ctrl+alt+shift+r++

<!-- -->

``` text
#' Title
#'
#' @param x 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
cEnter <- function(x) {
  x - mean(x)
}
```

Fill in the blanks.

**Package documentation (2)**

Title of the help page. Text on how to use.

The 4 tags (`@`) help organizing the doc: `@export` (tells R that this
function should be made available to people who load your package. ),
`@params`, `@return`, and `@examples`. There are many more advanced
tags.

Highlight a section and test it, run it.

**Package documentation (3)**

Build Tab/build the package.

-   ++ctrl+shift+d++

Compile all. Load all. Open the help page with `?function`.

Learn the `roxigen` workflow to ease the work.

**Test your package**

With the `testthat` (and `devtools`) package.

Install both packages. Run `devtools::use_testthat()` and a now
directory with subdir appears in the package. This is where we save
tests.

**Test your package (2)**

Ready. Write tests. Open a new R script and save it to the tests
directory. Create a `context` function. Add `test_that` functions with
arguments.

``` text
context("cEnter")

test_that("cEnter handles integers", {
  expect_equal(cEnter(1:3), -1:1)
  expect_equal(cEnter(-(1:3)), 1:-1)
})

context("scale")

test_that("scale handles integers", {
  expect_equal(scale(1:3), 1:3)
  expect_equal(scale(-(1:3)), -(1:3))
})

context("standardize")

test_that("standardize handles integers", {
  expect_equal(standardize(1:3), -1:1)
  expect_equal(standardize(-(1:3)), 1:-1)
})
```

**Test your package (3)**

Run the tests.

-   ++ctrl+shift+t++

Get a summary (pass or not pass). Test and retest the package.

See the book: [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).

**Time to test your package**

Run the test with Build Tab/Test package.

**Check your package**

Upload the package to GitHub. Recreate the package structure in the
repo. Download and install the package with `install_github()` from the
`devtools` package. Test the package on GitHub to complete the tests.
Type `R CMD check` in the terminal. Or Build Tab/Check icon.

-   ++ctrl+shift+e++

**Build your package**

A package is a tarball or package bundle.

Build Tab/Build & Reload. Install and load the package.

-   ++ctrl+shift+b++

Build and reload will overwrite the existing package. Run
`devtools::dev_mode()` creates a separate library for development.
Running the command again cancels it.

Two formats: source package or binary package (more compresses and
optimized).

See the book: [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html\#package).

Version Control
===============

**Introduction to Git**

Use Git to work in team. Even on R scripts, reports and packages.

Install Git.

In RStudio, Tools/Global Options/Git/SVN + Tools/Project Options/Select
VCS, restart RStudio. RStudio has now a Git pane and a Git icon.

**Stage & commit**

The Git Tab is a directory. The real life (local) version of the
project. The official version of the project as recorded with Git.

The two versions are different. View the differences. When you commit,
you add thing from the real to the official version.

Green highlighting indicates something you've added to the official
version, while red highlighting indicates lines you have removed.

**.gitignore**

Inside the project, ther is a .gignore file. Add file that are excluded
from the offcial version. The file can be accessed from the Git pane.

**Git icons**

Add, (cancel), commit, (cancel). The icons will changed.

**Commit history**

History viewer: each commitment. HEAD commit and parent commit. Master
branch or another.

**Undo commited changes: checkout**

Checkout command. Go back to a previous commit. The commit stays in the
history (not deleted).

Run it in the shell: Tools/shell.

`git checkout sha# nameofthefile` and Git will reverse the commit. The
file is in the stage area as before the commit.

**Undo uncommited changes**

The file is in the stage area, ready to commit. Cancel the addition.

In the Change window, click on the Revert button.

Or, click on Discard chunk.

Or, ++ctrl+z++ to undo.

Then, Save the file.

**Introduction to GitHub**

Centralize, host, track issues, track metrics.

Install a R package From GitHub with `install_github` from the the
`devtools` packages.

**Pull & Push**

Local and GitHub

**Wrap-up**

Go to help.github.com

Go to stackoverflow.com

Reporting
=========

**Tools for reporting**

R Markdown and Shiny (over the web).

**Introduction to R Markdown**

Text and code.

Web link: `<http://www>`

**R Markdown in RStudio**

Report (HTML, PDF, Word) or presentation(slide).

Create a template. Load in new templates. The `rticles` package has
templates for academic journals.

The outline (name the chunks).

Help/Markdown Quick Reference

Add a code chunk wih ++ctrl+alt+i++

**Rendering R Markdown**

Knit or preview. For pdf, need $\LaTeX$ (install).

Adding `runtime: shiny` generates a Shiny report. Launch the interactive
app.

Publish reports online.

**Compile notebook**

File/Compile Notebook for R script. The script becomes a report (Word,
PDF, HTML).

**RStudio's $\LaTeX$ editor**

[Install $\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/).

Open a .tex file in RStudio. RStudio has limited options to edit $\LaTeX$;
enough to write and compile.

The preview window is linked to the source window. If we click on a
character in the source window, press ++ctrl+"click"++: the corresponding
character is highlighted in the preview window. Vice-versa.

Tools/Global options/Sweave to change the $\LaTeX$ options.

**Shiny**

The server is online.

shiny.rstudio.com

When we create a Shiny app, we create two files: ui.R and server.R

Run App (the app) or ++ctrl+shift+enter++

**Publish Shiny apps**

Need an account and the `shinyapps` package.

`devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinyapps")`

Deploy the local app online. Unique URL. Monitor usage, view logs,
archive or delete the app. Max 5 apps at a time for free. Paid account.
